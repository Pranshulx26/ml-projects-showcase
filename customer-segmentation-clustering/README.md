# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates how to apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. We use the `Mall_Customers.csv` dataset for this purpose.

## Steps Involved:
- Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Feature Selection for Clustering
- Normalizing the Data
- Applying K-Means Clustering
- Visualizing the Clusters with Streamlit

## How to Run the App Locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pranshulx26/ml-projects-showcase.git
