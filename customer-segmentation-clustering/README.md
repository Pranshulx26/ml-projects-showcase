# Clustering Analysis with K-Means

## Project Overview
This project is a Streamlit application that enables users to perform clustering analysis using the K-Means algorithm on their datasets. Users can upload their CSV files, select features for clustering, visualize the results, and download the clustered data along with summary statistics.

### Key Features:
- **File Upload:** Users can upload a CSV file containing their data.
- **Feature Selection:** Users can choose which features (columns) to use for clustering.
- **K-Means Clustering:** The app implements the K-Means algorithm to cluster the data based on user-selected features.
- **Visualization:** Interactive visualizations are provided using Plotly to display clustering results.
- **Elbow Method:** The app assists users in determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
- **Download Option:** Users can download the clustered data for further analysis.
- **Cluster Summary Statistics:** The app displays summary statistics for each cluster.
